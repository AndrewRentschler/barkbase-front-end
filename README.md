# BarkBase
Disrupting the dog daycare experience! 
BarkBase revolutionizes care for your furry companions. 
Detailed profiles, seamless communication, and real-time updates. 
Personalized reports, attendance tracking, and a vibrant community. 

Where dogs thrive, owners connect. 

With BarkBase, dog owners can create a profile and add their dogs to our daycare database. 
Owners will be able to see dog‚Äôs reports after each visit to daycare. 

Daycare employees are site admins and are able to manage the dogs in their database. Admins can generate reports that track feeding times and activities performed, such as walks and agility training. Site admins can also update details for a dog, leave comments, or add a note within a dog detail or report.
